Hello there! Welcome to my blog, where I'll be sharing my adventures in the world of pharmacometrics. I'm Medhat, a passionate researcher currently pursuing my PhD in Pharmacometrics and working on drug repurposing of imatinib. But let me take you on a journey back in time to where it all began!

It all started during my undergraduate years at Leiden University, where I pursued my BSc and MSc in Bio-Pharmaceutical Sciences with a specialization in Division of Systems Biomedicine and Pharmacology. I was always fascinated by the power of computational approaches in understanding disease mechanisms and developing new therapeutic strategies.

During my early research projects, I delved into the world of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance. I worked on identifying biomarkers for bacterial infections using metabolomic approaches, with the aim of combating antibiotic resistance. It was an exciting journey that sparked my interest in the field of pharmacometrics and its potential to drive innovative solutions for pressing healthcare challenges.

As I progressed in my academic journey, I had the opportunity to work on a diverse range of projects. From developing mechanistic models for cardiovascular systems to exploring the use of mi-RNA biomarkers in stroke patients, each research experience has been unique and rewarding. Alongside my academic pursuits, I also had the privilege of mentoring and coaching first-year students at Leiden University, further fueling my passion for teaching and sharing knowledge.

Now, as I embark on my PhD journey in Pharmacometrics, I am thrilled to be working on drug repurposing of imatinib. It's a cutting-edge area of research with immense potential to make a positive impact on patient health and well-being. I am constantly learning and growing in my role, collaborating with fellow researchers and students to push the boundaries of pharmacometrics.

In my spare time, you can find me tinkering with R, as I continue to sharpen my technical skills. I am deeply grateful for the opportunities and experiences that have shaped my journey in pharmacometrics so far, and I am excited for the adventures that lie ahead.

I invite you to join me on this thrilling ride as I share my insights, challenges, and successes in the world of pharmacometrics. Stay tuned for more exciting updates, and feel free to reach out to me with any questions or comments. Let's embark on this journey together!

Until next time, 

Medhat
